# pyautogui-expandtesting_desktop

Desktop testing in [expandtesting](https://practice.expandtesting.com/notes/api/api-docs/) API documentation through PyAutoGUI. This project contains basic examples on how to use PyAutoGUI and other python libraries to open xterm in a display and send curl commands. Good practices such as hooks, custom commands and tags, among others, are used. All the necessary support documentation to develop this project is placed here.

# Tips:

- API tests to send password reset link to user's email and to verify a password reset token and reset a user's password must be tested manually as they rely on e-mail verification.
- Python presented better performance calling functions from same files as tests.
